# Private Journal Template
Every researcher should keep a lab notebook/research journal because:
- It allows you to document your work and process for scientific reasons!
- It allows you to keep a paper trail of your contributions to a project for legal purposes!
- It helps keep you organized and productive!

## General Guidlines for Maintaining a Private Research Journal

1. ### **Structure your journal** with clear sections and dates:
   ```markdown
   # Heading

   ## [Date: YYYY-MM-DD]
   
   ### Experiments
   - Description of experiment
   - Parameters used
   - Results observed
   '''python
    (code here)
   '''
   > ![Alt Text for a experiment plot](/"path/to"/experimentresults.jpg)
   
   ### Insights and Thoughts
   - Key findings
   - Questions raised
   
   ### Next Steps
   - Planned experiments
   - Items to investigate
   ```
2. ### **Best Practices**
    - **Date your entries**: Always include timestamps for each entry
    - **Be detailed**: Include experiment parameters, code snippets, and specific observations
    - **Link to commits**: Reference relevant commits by their SHA when documenting code-related insights
    - **Include visualizations**: Embed or reference plots, graphs, and diagrams
    - **Track hypotheses**: Document what you're testing and why
    - **Record failures**: Failed experiments are as valuable as successes
    - **Note resources**: Keep track of papers, documentation, and external resources consulted
3. ### Keeping Your Journal Private

    To prevent your research journal from being committed to the main branch, use these methods:

    #### Method 1: Using .gitignore (Recommended)

    1. **Create or edit** the `.gitignore` file in the project root:
    ```bash
    # Create .gitignore if it doesn't exist
    touch .gitignore
    ```

    2. **Add your journal files** to `.gitignore`:
    ```
    # Private research journals
    journals/research-journal.md
    journals/journal-file-name.md
    ```

    3. **Verify it's ignored**:
    ```bash
    git status  # Your journal should not appear in untracked files
    ```
### Team Collaboration on Journals

While individual journals should remain private, consider:

- **Shared insights document**: Create a separate `INSIGHTS.md` or `FINDINGS.md` for team-wide learnings
- **Meeting notes**: Use a `meetings/` directory for collaborative documentation
- **Experiment logs**: Create a shared experiment tracking system separate from personal journals

### Selected rules to keeping a research journal/notebook from the link below:

> #### Rule 4: Record All Scientific Activities in Your Lab Notebook
> 
> There are scientists who believe that lab notebook records should be limited to wet or dry lab experimental entries. However, the intellectual activity of a theoretical scientist is not limited to experiments to test hypotheses. Thinking about the possible directions of your research and theorizing about how a system works is often how scientific breakthroughs are made. If you use paper pads or other assorted pieces of paper to write down your ideas or take notes during meetings and seminars, you may lose important items or waste too much time looking for ideas later. Recording your scientific activities will solve this problem. Scientists should record every experiment, every result, every research meeting, notes from seminars, research conference calls, thoughts related to their research problem—all of these items go into their lab notebooks. In a very real way, the lab notebook is a chronological log of everything scholarly a scientist does. Each lab notebook entry should be written immediately after the activity or work was performed.
> 
> #### Rule 5: Every Entry Should Be Recorded with a Date, Subject, and Protocol
>The most logical organization of a lab notebook is chronological. Each entry should contain the date it was made and subject of the entry. If you make distinct sets of entries in the same day, you should separate them by using heading titles and leave sufficient space between the entries [1]. The titles of your entries are important. They should be short, sharp, and informative, as you will use them to build a table of contents for your lab notebook. If you are using a paper lab notebook, you will need to write the date and time stamp and make your entries legible, written in permanent ink and in a language accessible to everyone in the laboratory. If you use an electronic lab notebook, the date and time stamps will be entered automatically for each new subject.

> You should also include a brief background for each entry [2]. It could be a short synopsis of your thought process that explains why this entry is important for your scientific work. You can support it with references published in the literature, ideas learned from a research talk, or a previous model developed by your laboratory. Then, record everything you do for this specific entry. If you make a mistake in your paper lab notebook, put a thin line through the mistake and write the new information next to it [1]. Never erase or destroy an entry, because errors or mistakes are an important part of the scientific process.

> #### Rule 6: Keep a Record of How Every Result Was Produced
> The gold standard of science is reproducibility [7]. You need to keep a record of how every result was produced in your in silico experiments, statistical analyses, and mathematical or computational models. Noting the sequence of steps taken allows for a result or analysis to be reproduced. For every step in your model, analysis, or experiment, you should record every detail that will influence its execution [8]. This includes the preparation of your wet or dry experiment, preprocessing, execution with intermediate steps, analysis, and postprocessing of results [1,2]. You should also store the raw data for every figure. This will allow you to have the exact values for the visualization of your results. It will also give you the opportunity to redraw figures to improve their quality or ensure visual consistency for publication.

> If a result is obtained through a mathematical model, algorithm, or computer program, you need to include the equations and name and version of the algorithm or computer program, as well as the initial conditions and parameters used in the model. In many instances, a statistical or computational analysis creates intermediate data [9]. You should record intermediate results because they can reveal discrepancies with your final results, particularly if your analysis is time consuming or readily executable. At the same time, they can help you track any inconsistencies in your analysis or algorithms [8]. Electronic lab notebooks can be very convenient for storing data and linking to computer mathematical models, algorithms, and software stored in cloud mass storage systems.
> #### Rule 7: Use Version Control for Models, Algorithms, and Computer Code
> As a mathematical and computational biologist, you will be updating your models, algorithms, or computer programs frequently. You will also create scripts containing initial conditions and parameters to run analyses or simulations. Changes in your models, algorithms, programs, or scripts could drastically change your results. If you do not systematically archive changes, it will be very difficult or impossible to track the codes that you used to generate certain results [8,9]. Nowadays, there are version control systems to track the evolution of algorithms and computer programs or changes in scripts. Bitbucket, Git, Subversion, and Mercurial are among the most widely used version-control systems. You should use a standardized name system to identify changes. If you have a paper lab notebook, you should record the name and location of the scripts. Those using electronic lab notebooks can add links to each version of their scripts or programs.
> #### Rule 8: Keep a Lab Notebook That Can Serve As a Legal Record of Your Work
> The lab notebook serves as a legal record of ownership of ideas and results [10]. Lab notebooks can serve to determine authorship in scientific papers or rights for establishing copyright or patent rights. If you do not feel comfortable walking around with a notebook or having more than one lab notebook, you can still record all your notes in paper pads, but you should file them in a ring binder using the indexing system of a lab notebook. You can also use a tablet if you keep an electronic lab notebook. However, this is not generally advisable. At the moment, bound notebooks with numbered pages are the only legally recognized option to record and protect your work. Electronic records can be printed out on a regular basis and then bound to form a legally recognized laboratory notebook. If you keep a loose-leaf lab notebook, you should have a parallel hardbound notebook summarizing progress on your projects as a legal record of your work. For each lab notebook entry, clearly indicate who did what work and who was present for a discussion or in silico experiment; this is particularly important for collaborative projects. In addition, each entry should be signed by you and cosigned by a coworker or supervisor. Otherwise, the entry will not serve as a legally valid record.

> It is important to note that lab notebooks can be subpoenaed as evidence in cases of scientific misconduct by your institution or governmental funding agencies. According to educational material provided by the Office of Research Integrity at the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the University of New Hampshire, “The integrity of research and scholarly activities depends on accurate, detailed, organized, complete, and accessible data” [11]. From the legal point of view, you keep a lab notebook to reflect your own scientific integrity and to give others the opportunity to corroborate the results of your research. If you keep an electronic lab notebook, you can make it open to the public. This will make your work more transparent to the scientific community, and it will give the opportunity for other scientists to learn more about your research, including the experiments and models that did not work out.

> #### Rule 9: Create a Table of Contents for Your Lab Notebook
> You should record the titles of all entries in your lab notebook in a table of contents as you finish each entry or day. The idea of this index is to help you, your research supervisor, or someone else find the record of your scientific work efficiently [1,2]. There are multiple formats for the table of contents. You should use the format agreed upon in your laboratory. It is generally advisable that each entry in the table of contents has the date the entry has been made, the subject of your entry, and where in the lab notebook the entry can be found. To find information easily in your lab notebook, you should always start an event in a new page. Then, label the event accordingly ("Research Review with Dr. Williams," "Seminar by Dr. Murray," "Thoughts on Project X," etc.) and date it. Once you have done this, you can start taking notes and take as many pages as you need. If you have the standard paper lab notebook, the pages will be numbered. Now you will be in the position to move forward with the critical step: create a table of contents on the first page of your notebook, where you will log the event and page number. If you do not have the standard lab notebook, you can put a page number at the top of each pair of pages counting by two. An advantage of electronic lab notebooks is that you do not need to worry about creating a table of contents because it will be done automatically for you.
